# Not Your Jewels 🎓💎  

**Gamified student microcredit platform built with Scaffold-ETH - Now Multichain**  

A decentralized solution to address university dropout rates in Latin America through blockchain-based microloans with academic performance incentives, expanded across multiple networks for better accessibility and lower costs.  

---

## 🚨 The Problem  
University dropout rates due to financial limitations are critically high in Latin America:  

- **57%** dropout rate in Guatemala  
- **53%** dropout rate in Honduras  
- **16%** dropout rate in Bolivia  

Many students resort to pawning personal belongings, including jewelry, to continue their education.  
This represents a systemic failure where education becomes a privilege instead of a right.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  
**Not Your Jewels** is a gamified microcredit platform built on Scaffold-ETH that provides decentralized educational financing with performance-driven incentives across multiple blockchain networks.  

---

## 🔗 Multichain Architecture  

### Ethereum Mainnet (Core Infrastructure)  
- Scaffold-ETH 2 framework for rapid dApp development  
- ENS integration for human-readable identities  
- Primary smart contracts and governance  

### Lisk L2 (Fast & Cheap Transactions)  
- Microloan processing with reduced transaction costs  
- Instant transactions for better student UX  
- Scalability for mass adoption  

### ENS (Web3 Identity)  
- Human-readable identities (e.g., `emmi.eth`) instead of complex addresses  
- Significant improvement in UX and trust  
- Cross-chain identity integration  

### Symbiotic SDK (Cross-Chain Bridge)  
- Multichain bridges between different networks  
- Shared liquidity across chains  
- Future expansion without complete restructuring
